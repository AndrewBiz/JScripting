 ## VARIABLES (Exercise 2 of 20)  
   
  A variable is a name that can reference a specific value. Variables are  
  declared using let followed by the variable's name.  
   
  Here's an example:  
   
     let example  
   
  The above variable is declared, but it isn't defined (it does not yet  
  reference a specific value).  
   
  Here's an example of defining a variable, making it reference a specific  
  value:  
   
     const example = 'some string'  
   
 # NOTE  
   
  A variable is declared using let and uses the equals sign to define the  
  value that it references. This is colloquially known as "Making a variable  
  equal a value".  
   
 ## The challenge:  
   
  Create a file named variables.js.  
   
  In that file declare a variable named example.  
   
  Make the variable example equal to the value 'some string'.  
   
  Then use console.log() to print the example variable to the console.  
   
  Check to see if your program is correct by running this command:  
   
  javascripting verify variables.js
